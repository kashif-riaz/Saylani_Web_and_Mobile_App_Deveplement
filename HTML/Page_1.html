    <h2><li><ins><i>A Good Boy</i></ins></li></h2>
    <p>An old woman wanted to cross a road. She was weak. Therefore she wanted help. She waited long. She waited alone.

        She saw a large number of school boys. They were laughing and talking. They were going home. So they were happy. They looked at the old woman. They did not help her. They walked on.
        
        But one boy went to the old woman. He said to her, “Mother! Do you want to cross the road? I will help you. I will take you to the other side."
        
        The boy helped the old woman. He led her across the road. He did a good deed. He was happy. He said, “I helped somebody’s mother. So, somebody will help my mother in her old age."
        
        “Dear God! Be kind to this good boy," said the old woman in her prayer.</p>

    <h2><li><ins><i>A Farmer and His Wife</i></ins></li></h2>
    <p>A farmer said to his wife, “You are lazy. You work slowly and lethargically. You waste your time."

        The wife was angry at the words of her husband.
        
        She said to her husband, “You are wrong. Stay at home tomorrow. I will go to field. I will do your work there. Will you do my works at home here?"
        
        The farmer said happily, “Very well. I will do your works back at home."
        
        The wife said, “Milk the cow. Feed the pigs. Wash the utensils. Take care of our hen. Spin the yarn."
        
        The woman went to the field. The farmer stayed back at home. He took a vessel and went to the cow to milk it. He tried to milk the cow. He received a good kick. He then went to the pig-sty. He hit his head against the beam. He went to feed the hen. He forgot to spin.
        
        The wife returned from the field when it turned evening. The farmer hung down his head in shame. Thereafter he did not find fault with his wife. They lived happily together for a long time.

   <h2><li><ins><i>A Rich Man and His Son</i></ins></li></h2>
   <p>A rich man's son was graduating college.

    For months, the son was asking his father for a new car, knowing that his father had more than enough money.
    
    When graduation day came, the young man's father called him into the study. The father handed him a wrapped gift and congratulated him about his graduation and his achievement.
    
    Looking disappointed, the son opened the gift to find a lovely, leather bound journal, with the young man's name embossed on the cover. He angrily raised his voice, threw down the journal and stormed out.
    
    The young man had not seen his father since graduation day. He became successful and was wealthy like his father, with a beautiful home and family. He came to realize his father was aging and it may be time to put the past behind them.
    
    Just then, he received a message that his father had passed, and he had to return home to take care of the estate.
    
    As the mourning son regretfully returned home, he began searching through his father's important papers and saw that still new journal, just as he had left it.
    
    He opened it, and as he flipped through the pages a car key dropped from the back of the journal.
    
    A dealer tag was attached to the key that read "Paid in full. Wherever this car takes you, write about it to remember it forever. Love, Dad"
